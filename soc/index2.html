        ALL: My Lord, Jesus Christ,<br> 
            You have made this journey to die for me with unspeakable love;<br> 
            and I have so many times ungratefully abandoned You. But now I love You with all my heart;<br>gygbyhh
            and, because I love You, I am sincerely sorry for ever having offended You.<br>
            Pardon me, my God, and permit me to accompany You on this journey.<br>
            You go to die for love of me;<br> 
            I want, my beloved Redeemer, to die for love of You.<br> 
            My Jesus, I will live and die always united to You.

          V: Consider how Jesus Christ, after being scourged and crowned with thorns, was unjustly condemned by Pilate to die on the cross. (Kneel)<br><br>
          R: My adorable Jesus, it was not Pilate; no, it was my sins that condemned You to die. I beseech You, by the merits of this sorrowful journey, to assist my soul on its journey to eternity. I love You, beloved Jesus; I love You more than I love myself. With all my heart I repent of ever having offended You. Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br><br>

Never let me separate myself from You again. Grant that I may love You always; and then do with me as You will.<br><br>
